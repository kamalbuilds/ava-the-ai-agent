# Ava Portfolio Manager AI Agent

## Project Overview
- Ava is a DeFi portfolio management platform using specialized autonomous AI agents
- Agents work together to analyze, recommend, and execute optimal DeFi strategies
- Currently deployed on Flow, Hedera, Sui, Base, Avalanche, Mode, Arbitrium
- Powered by Story Protocol and LangChain

## Current Status
- Event-based communication between agents using EventBus
- Each agent has specialized roles (observer, executor, task-manager, etc.)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) implemented for tool usage
- No standardized agent-to-agent communication protocol

## Implemented Features
- Natural language interface for portfolio goals
- Autonomous execution of financial transactions
- Cross-chain operations
- Treasury management
- Privacy & security with Lit Protocol
- Real-time event communication

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Implement Google's A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol for standardized agent communication
- [ ] Set up MCP servers for tools and resources
- [ ] Create A2A server endpoints for each agent 
- [ ] Modify frontend to support A2A protocol
- [ ] Update README.md to reflect A2A implementation
- [ ] Integrate ZerePy for Twitter interaction

## Implementation Plan
- Create A2A-compliant agent cards for each agent
- Set up task endpoint APIs
- Implement capability discovery
- Enable secure collaboration between agents
- Support multimodal communication (text, forms, files)
- Ensure task and state management
