interface AgentCollaboration {
  observer: Observer;      // Monitors positions and market conditions
  executor: Executor;      // Handles transaction execution
  taskManager: TaskManager;// Coordinates multi-step operations
  suiAgent: SuiAgent;     // SUI-specific operations
  elizaAgent: ElizaAgent; // User interaction and strategy explanation
}
```
