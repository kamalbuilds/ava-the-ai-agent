## Conclusion

Ava's tokenomics model is designed to create a sustainable, decentralized ecosystem that aligns incentives across all stakeholders while supporting the platform's growth and innovation. The combination of utility-driven demand, deflationary mechanisms, and governance participation creates multiple value accrual paths for token holders.

The model balances the need for initial funding through token sales with long-term value creation through revenue sharing and ecosystem growth. By maintaining less than 10% equity dilution while raising $500K-$1M, the founding team retains control while accessing necessary capital for growth.

The integration with EigenLayer AVS provides unique revenue opportunities and establishes Ava as a leader in decentralized portfolio validation, creating additional utility and demand for AVA tokens beyond traditional DeFi use cases.

This tokenomics framework provides the foundation for sustainable growth, community governance, and long-term value creation in the rapidly evolving DeFi and AI landscape.
